# create with frens

This is a 1.19.2 fabric Create-based modpack, intended to be used on a multiplayer server.  
So far it seems fairly balanced, and is really fun to play and often very immersive.

## Mods
- Create & Addons
- Automobility
- ComputerCraft
- Better Nether & End
- SimpleHats

- *Fancy world gen...*
- *Optimisation...*

## Issues

World gen is known to sometimes create odd structures.  
This is usually a mod clashing with Terralith or other wold gen stuff.
